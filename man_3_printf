NAME
_Printf
    _Printf functions in the _printf family produce output according to a format as described below
SYNOPSIS
  printf Function with one mandatory argument FORMAT shown as follows:
  int _printf(const char *format, ...); 
DESCRIPTION
    
    The functions:
    In the _printf family produce output according to a format as described below. The functions and write output to stdout; write output to the given output stream; and write to the character string.
    
    Return value:
    Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printe(excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
    
    Format of the format string:
    The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; an conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier. In between there may be (in this order zero or more flags, an optional minimum field width, an optional precision an an optional length modifier.
    
    Conversion Specifiers:
    The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any.

    The character % is followed by zero or more of the following flags:
    
    Print a character.
    Print a single integer.
    Print a decimal numberPrint a string.
    Print a binary.
    Print reverse.
    Print ROT13.
    Print and unsigned number.
    Print Octal.
    Print Hexadecimal.
EXAMPLES
   _printf("String:[%s]\n", "I am a string !");
   String:[I am a string !]

   len = _printf("Let's try to printf a simple sentence.\n");
   Length:[39, 39]

   _printf("Negative:[%d]\n", -762534);
   Negative:[-762534]
   
   _printf("Unsigned:[%u]\n", ui);
   Unsigned:[2147484671]

   _printf("Unsigned octal:[%o]\n", ui);
    Unsigned octal:[20000001777]

    _printf("Unsigned hexadecimal:[%x, %X]\n", ui, ui);
    Unsigned hexadecimal:[800003ff, 800003FF]

    _printf("Character:[%c]\n", 'H');
    Character:[H]

    _printf("Address:[%p]\n", addr);
    Address:[0x7ffe637541f0]

    len = _printf("Percent:[%%]\n");
    Percent:[%]

    _printf("Unknown:[%r]\n");
    Len:[12]
